<p>I want to be able to travel after I graduate and explore places I've been wanting to go. Some things I'd like to do is explore more of Europe, with one key place being italy. I would explore italy because I love italian food and I also think that Italy has a lot of interesting history and architecture which would be fun to see as well.
