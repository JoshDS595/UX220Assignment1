<p>With my field being in UX, ideally I'd want to find a career in UX in the near future. A good start is applying to co-op where I could then potentially grow my skill set with a placement. In terms of a professional goal for myself, Iâ€™d like to improve my networking skills and get to know more people in my field and also learn skills from those individuals. I'd also want to continue to grow my skills in UX and gather more work experience.
