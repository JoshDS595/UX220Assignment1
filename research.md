<p>One article that may contradict my goals for social networking would be an article highlighting a study done that finds a correlation between social networking sites and irrational procrastination. Within this article, it states that a study was conducted with undergraduate students to find if social networking site fatigue has an effect on irrational procrastination, in the end it was revealed that both items positively correlated with each other. This can contradict my goals for increasing my focus on social networking, as potentially there could be disadvantages among the advantages.

<p>An article that aligns with my goals discusses the benefits of cooperative education in health sectors and why it can be a more beneficial method for learning. Although this article deals with a study of specifically the benefits of co-op for health care sectors, I believe that the benefits can be applied universally or to many fields, including UX. They found within this study that students that graduated from co-op programs developed highly sought after skills such as determination, teamwork, and leadership skills, along with experience working in their field. The results from this study show immense benefits to co-op, regardless of whether these are in health-care or hospitality sectors, the previously stated skills I believe can also be beneficial to UX and could be acquired in a UX co-op placement. Therefore I believe this article could align with and support my professional goals set for myself to get into a UX co-op placement.
